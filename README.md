Hello everyone!
Welcome to the official repository for **DS605: Fundamentals of Machine Learning** offered in the Autumn 2025 semester at DAU.

This course will take you through the foundations of machine learning - from understanding the core principles to building and deploying ML models using Python. Youâ€™ll explore real-world problems, work in teams, tackle coding challenges, and develop a complete ML project by the end of the semester.

### ðŸŒŸ Stay Motivated

Youâ€™re about to start a journey that powers everything from Netflix recommendations to self-driving cars. It's okay to feel overwhelmed - just remember, **every expert was once a beginner.** Stay curious, collaborate with peers, and don't be afraid to ask questions.

Letâ€™s build something amazing. One line of code at a time.

Happy Learning! ðŸš€
